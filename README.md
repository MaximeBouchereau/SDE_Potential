Python codes to solve Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE's) with potential (e.g. Langevin). On long times, solution (represented by a rendom variable) follows Gibbs measure (linked with potential).

### SDE Potential 1D ###

One dimensional case (e.g. Langevin).

### SDE Potential 3D & SDE Potential 3D Vertical ###

Case of three dimensions. Solution of Langevin's equation descrives velocities of particles with a potential. Trajectories are represented here in a box which is closed or open at the top.
